# TrajectoryGamesBase

[![CI](https://github.com/lassepe/TrajectoryGamesBase.jl/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lassepe/TrajectoryGamesBase.jl/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A package that contains the problem interface and related types for trajectory games. The trajectory games considered here are played over continuous action spaces in *discrete time*. That is, this package currently does not support differential games.

Note that this package does not contain any solver code. It merely serves as abstraction to share problem description and solvers.

## Usage

This README will be expanded to include more concrete usage instructions. Until then, please refer to the `test/runtets.jl` file as a source of implicit documentation.
